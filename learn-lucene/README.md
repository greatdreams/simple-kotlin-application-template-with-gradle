The Apache LuceneTM project develops open-source search software, including:

* [Lucene Core](https://lucene.apache.org/core/), our flagship sub-project, provides Java-based indexing and search technology, as well as spellchecking, hit highlighting and advanced analysis/tokenization capabilities.
* [Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr) is a high performance search server built using Lucene Core, with XML/HTTP and JSON/Python/Ruby APIs, hit highlighting, faceted search, caching, replication, and a web admin interface.
* [PyLucene](https://lucene.apache.org/pylucene/index.html) is a Python port of the Core project.
