###### What's apache spark?

Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.

Apache Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data.
It provides high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine 
that supports general computation graphs for data analysis. 
It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for 
SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph
 processing, and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
