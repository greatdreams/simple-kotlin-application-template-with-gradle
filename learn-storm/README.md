###### learn-storm?

learn-storm is a project where we learn how to program with apache storm?

Apache Storm is a free and open source distributed realtime computation system.
Storm makes it easy to reliably process unbounded streams of data, 
doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch processing. 
Storm is simple, can be used with any programming language, and is a lot of fun to use!
