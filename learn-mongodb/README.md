##### What's mongodb?

MongoDB is an open-source document database that
provides high performance, high availability, and
automatic scaling.

A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure 
composed of field and value pairs. MongoDB documents are
 similar to JSON objects. The values of fields may include
  other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents.

The advantages of using documents are:

* Documents (i.e. objects) correspond to native data types in many programming languages.
* Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins.
* Dynamic schema supports fluent polymorphism.

###### start mongodb server
```bash
$$MONGODB_HOME/mongod
```
Example

```bash
$ export MONGODB_HOME=/Users/greatdreams/softwares/mongodb-osx-x86_64-3.6.3
$ mkdir -p $MONGODB_HOME/data/db
$ $MONGODB_HOME/bin/mongod --dbpath $MONGODB_HOME/data/db --bind_ip 127.0.0.1 --port 27017
```

##### Database and Collections
* MongoDB stores [BSON documents](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/#bson-document-format),
 i.e. data records, in [collections](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-collection); 
 the collections in databases.
*  In MongoDB, databases hold collections of documents.
*  MongoDB stores documents in collections. Collections are analogous to tables in relational databases.
* If a database does not exist, MongoDB creates the database when you first store data for that database. As such, 
  you can switch to a non-existent database and perform the following operation in the mongo shell:
  
  ```$xslt
  use myNewDB
  
  db.myNewCollection1.insertOne( { x: 1 } )
  ```
* MongoDB stores documents in collections. Collections are analogous to tables in relational databases.  
* If a collection does not exist, MongoDB creates the collection when you first store data for that collection.

  ```$xslt
   db.myNewCollection2.insertOne( { x: 1 } )
   db.myNewCollection3.createIndex( { y: 1 } )
  ```
* By default, a collection does not require its documents to have the same schema; i.e. the documents in a single collection do not need to have the same set of fields and the data type for a field can differ across documents within a collection.
  
  Starting in MongoDB 3.2, however, you can enforce document validation rules for a collection during update and insert operations. See Schema Validation for details. 
  
##### Document

 MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents. BSON is a binary representation of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON. For the BSON spec, 
 see bsonspec.org. See also BSON Types.
